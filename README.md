## aws-crt-s3-benchmarks

This project is for benchmarking different S3 workloads using various languages and libraries.

## Running Benchmarks

### Minimum Requirements

*   Python 3.9+ with pip

If you use Amazon Linux 2023 (recommended), there are scripts to help install further tools.

To run **ALL** the benchmarks, your machine needs 300+ GiB of disk space available,
and fast enough internet to upload a terabyte to S3 within your lifetime.
But if you're only running 1 benchmark, you'll upload fewer files and use less disk space.

Your machine must have AWS credentials, with permission to read and write to an S3 bucket.

### Get Started

First, clone this repo.

Then install packages needed by the python scripts:
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r aws-crt-s3-benchmarks/scripts/requirements.txt
```

### Prepare S3 Files

Next, run `prep-benchmark-files.py`. This script creates and configures
an S3 bucket, put files in S3 for benchmarks to download,
and create files on disk for benchmarks to upload:

```sh
./aws-crt-s3-benchmarks/scripts/prep-benchmark-files.py --bucket BUCKET --region REGION --files-dir FILES_DIR [--benchmark BENCHMARK]
```
*   `--bucket BUCKET`: S3 Bucket (created if necessary)
*   `--region REGION`: AWS region (e.g. us-west-2)
*   `--files-dir FILES_DIR`: Root directory for files to upload and download (e.g. ~/files) (created if necessary)
*   `--benchmark BENCHMARK`: Path to specific benchmark.run.json file.
        May be specified multiple times.
        If not specified, everything in [benchmarks/](benchmarks/) is prepared
        (uploading 100+ GiB to S3 and creating 100+ GiB on disk).

This script can be run repeatedly. It skips unnecessary work
(e.g. won't upload a file that already exists).

### Build a Runner

You must build a "runner" for the library you'll be benchmarking.
For example, [runners/s3-benchrunner-c](runners/s3-benchrunner-c/) tests the
[aws-c-s3](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-s3/) library.
See [runners/](runners/#readme) for more info.

Every runner comes with 2 scripts, which you should run now.

`install-tools.py` installs tools on Amazon Linux 2023
(On another OS? Read the script to see what you need):
```sh
./aws-crt-s3-benchmarks/runners/RUNNER_X/scripts/install-tools.py
```

And `build.py` to build the runner:
```sh
./aws-crt-s3-benchmarks/runners/RUNNER_X/scripts/build.py --build-dir BUILD_DIR
```
*   `--build-dir BUILD_DIR`: Root directory for build artifacts and git clones of dependencies
        (e.g. ~/build/RUNNER_X)

The last line of output from `build.py` displays the `RUNNER_CMD`
you'll need in the next step.

NOTE: Each runner has a `README.md` with more advanced instructions.
`build.py` isn't meant to handle advanced use cases like tweaking dependencies,
iterating locally, DEBUG builds, etc.

### Run a Benchmark

All runners have the same command line interface, and expect to be run from the
`FILES_DIR` you passed to the [prep-benchmark-files.py](#prepare-s3-files) script.

```sh
cd FILES_DIR

RUNNER_CMD BENCHMARK BUCKET REGION TARGET_THROUGHPUT
```

*   `RUNNER_CMD`: Command to launch runner (e.g. java -jar path/to/runner.jar)
        This is the last line printed by `build.py` in the [previous step](#build-a-runner).
*   `BENCHMARK`: Path to benchmark `.run.json` file (see: [benchmarks/](../benchmarks))
*   `BUCKET`: S3 bucket name (e.g. my-test-bucket)
*   `REGION`: AWS Region (e.g. us-west-2)
*   `TARGET_THROUGHPUT`: Target throughput, in gigabits per second.
        Floating point allowed. Enter the EC2 type's "Network Bandwidth (Gbps)"
        (e.g. "100.0" for [c5n.18xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/))

Most runners should search for AWS credentials
[something like this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#configure-precedence).

If you want to run multiple benchmarks (or ALL benchmarks) in one go,
use this helper script: [run-benchmarks.py](scripts/run-benchmarks.py).
